//How to get difference between two rows for a column field?
// Synthesis failed: difference between rows is not supported.

#input

rowInt,  Value
2,       23
3,       45
17,      10
9,       0

#output

rowInt,  Value, Diff
2,       23,    22
3,       45,    -45
9,       0,     10
17,      10,    -10

#constraint

}

#solution

SELECT
   [current].rowInt,
   [current].Value,
   ISNULL([next].Value, 0) - [current].Value
FROM
   sourceTable       AS [current]
LEFT JOIN
   sourceTable       AS [next]
      ON [next].rowInt = (SELECT MIN(rowInt) FROM sourceTable WHERE rowInt > [current].rowInt)

select rowint, value, lead(value, 1, 0) over (order by rowint) - value as diff from input1;
